# Front-end code
## Structure
There are three versions:
* general version (Home Page)
* chunksize version
* array size version

For folder "js", since our code uses jQuery and ECharts, we need to import the "echarts.min.js" and "jquery.min.js" so that we can use ECharts and jQuery in our code.
"js_base.js" contains functions that is used for the three HTML files. In addition, each HTML version corresponds to a specified JS file.

## Run
If you just simply want to see the front-end, you can open any HTML file of the three versions, then you can see the UI.
